# Volvo 240 Dash Tachometer
A tachometer with IC date codes from 1985 week 16 was repaired. Schematic shown here. The tach is effectively the SAK15 (a tach specific IC) with increased filtering and protections on the rails.  
For reference the repaired unit had a shorted electrolytic capacitor (dead short, 47u 16V), at some point the unit had repairs done in the past wherby a quad parallel array of 330R resistors were used as a 1/2W 82R replacement. This stackup had experienced overheating (board browning and resistor coating heat damage, bands almost charred) likely due to much more current flowing through the components due to a shorted cap.  
Post repair at 12.0V the unit consumes 2.6mA with no signal line connected.
